  <h1>The Pond</h1>

  <h2>By John Frederick Freeman</h2>

  <p>Gray were the rushes beside the budless bushes, green-patched the pond. The lark had left soaring though yet the
    sun was pouring his gold here and beyond.</p>

  <div class="line-separator"></div>

  <p>Bramble-branches held me, but had they not compelled me yet had I lingered there, hearing the frogs and then
    watching the water-hen that stared back at my stare.</p>

  <div class="line-separator"></div>

  <p>There amid the bushes were blackbird's nests and thrush's, soon to be hidden in leaves on green leaves thickening,
    boughs over long boughs quickening swiftly, unforbidden.</p>

  <div class="line-separator"></div>

  <p>The lark had left singing but song all round was ringing, as though the rushes were sighingly repeating and
    mingling that most sweet thing with the sweet note of thrushes.</p>

  <div class="line-separator"></div>

  <p>That sweetness rose all round me, but more than sweetness bound me, a spirit stirred; shadowy and cold it neared
    me, then shrank as if it feared meâ€”but 'twas I that feared.</p>

  <div class="line-separator"></div>
